## Project Details

Upon accessing the project's host, you will be directed to the login page.

The project includes two roles: **admin** and **manager**.

By default, an admin account is available for authentication with the following credentials:

- **Email**: admin@gmail.com
- **Password**: admin

After successful login, you will be redirected to the applications page. The displayed fields for each application include:

- id, name, surname, email, phone, age, course, course_format, course_type, status, sum, alreadyPaid, created_at

The applications are paginated, with a default of 25 applications per page, listed in descending order.

The pagination panel operates as follows:

- When you are on the first page: **First Page**
- When you are on a page in the first half of all pages, excluding the first: **First Half**
- When you are on a page in the second half of all pages, excluding the last: **Second Half**
- When you are on the last page: **Last Page**

The current page should be reflected in the query parameters. When accessing the project via a query parameter, you should be directed to the corresponding page.

Ordering can be applied to each column by clicking on the column name. This triggers sorting in either ascending or descending order, and the sorting choice is stored in the query parameters.

Additional columns are added:

- **manager**: Indicates the manager assigned to process the application.
- **group**: Represents the group to which the application can be assigned.

Clicking on an application expands its details:

- The "Message" and "UTM" fields display information from the database table.
- An input field allows you to enter comments.
- Comments can only be added to applications without an assigned manager.
- Upon submitting a comment, the current user's surname is recorded in the "manager" column, and the status is set to "In Work" if it was previously null or "New."
- The comment, author, and date should be displayed.

Clicking the "EDIT" button opens a modal window with an edit form:

- Only applications without an assigned manager can be edited.
- All form fields can be left empty.
- The form include functionality to add a new group directly from the form (the group name must be unique).
- Performed validation.

2. Enter the URL, replacing :the appropriate parameter with the actual value.
3. Customize any necessary headers or parameters for the request.
4. Click the Send button (or press the Enter hotkey) to send the request.<p> Remember that you must have the server running on your `http://localhost:<PORT>` to successfully connect and receive a response.</p>
